Notes for VS Code setup

The main thing that needs configuration is the vim keybinds.

We need to install the Vim plugin / extension. Here is a link for the docs that are very helpful: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim

Here are the key things to note from there

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Debugging keybinds that aren't working

Adjust the extension's logging level to 'debug' and open the Output window:

1. Run Developer: Set Log Level from the command palette.
2. Select Vim, then Debug
3. Run Developer: Reload window
4. In the bottom panel, open the Output tab and select Vim from the dropdown selection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. VS Code has a lot of nifty tricks and we try to preserve some of them:

gd - jump to definition.
gq - on a visual selection reflow and wordwrap blocks of text, preserving commenting style. Great for formatting documentation comments.
gb - adds another cursor on the next word it finds which is the same as the word under the cursor.
af - visual mode command which selects increasingly large blocks of text. For example, if you had "blah (foo [bar 'ba|z'])" then it would select 'baz' first. If you pressed af again, it'd then select [bar 'baz'], and if you did it a third time it would select "(foo [bar 'baz'])".
gh - equivalent to hovering your mouse over wherever the cursor is. Handy for seeing types and error messages without reaching for the mouse!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Mac specific setup

To enable key-repeating, execute the following in your Terminal, log out and back in, and then restart VS Code:

defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false              # For VS Code
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false      # For VS Code Insider
defaults write com.vscodium ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false                      # For VS Codium
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCodeExploration ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false   # For VS Codium Exploration users
defaults delete -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled                                           # If necessary, reset global default
